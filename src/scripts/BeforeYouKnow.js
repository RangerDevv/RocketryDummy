        "Title" : "Planning",
        "Desc" : "At our space travel company, we take planning very seriously. We have a team of experienced professionals who carefully plan every aspect of the space travel experience. They consider factors such as the best time to launch, the most suitable spacecraft for the destination, the optimal flight path and duration, and the potential risks and challenges along the way. Our planning process is thorough and detailed to ensure a safe and successful trip to space. <br>The best time to launch depends on the orbital alignment of the Earth and the destination planet. We use sophisticated software to calculate the optimal launch window that minimizes the fuel consumption and maximizes the safety margin. <br>-The most suitable spacecraft for the destination depends on the distance, the gravity, the atmosphere, and the terrain of the planet. We have a fleet of different spacecrafts that are designed and tested for various scenarios and environments. We match each spacecraft to the specific requirements and preferences of each customer. <br>-The optimal flight path and duration depends on the speed, the direction, and the angle of the spacecraft. We use advanced algorithms to optimize the flight path and duration that balances the comfort, the efficiency, and the reliability of the trip. We also account for possible perturbations and contingencies that may affect the flight. <br>The potential risks and challenges along the way depend on the weather, the space debris, the communication, and the health of the crew and passengers. We use rigorous protocols and procedures to mitigate and manage any risks and challenges that may arise during the trip. We also have backup plans and emergency systems in place to ensure a smooth and safe journey.",

        "Title" : "Training",
        "Desc" : "Before embarking on their space journey, all of our customers undergo rigorous training to prepare them for the physical and mental challenges of space travel. Our training program covers everything from zero-gravity simulations to emergency procedures, giving our customers the skills and confidence they need to succeed in space. <br>Zero-gravity simulations: These are sessions where our customers experience the sensation of weightlessness in a specially designed chamber or aircraft. They learn how to move, balance, and perform tasks in a zero-gravity environment. They also get used to the effects of zero-gravity on their body and mind, such as nausea, disorientation, and fatigue. <br>Emergency procedures: These are drills where our customers practice how to handle various scenarios that may occur during the trip, such as fire, depressurization, power outage, or medical emergency. They learn how to use the safety equipment, communicate with the ground control, and follow the instructions of the crew. They also learn how to cope with stress, fear, and panic in a crisis situation. <br> If you chose the Premium plan, you will also have access to our exclusive training program, where you will learn how to navigate and operate your spacecraft, as well as participate in simulated space missions to prepare you for the real thing. <br>Navigate and operate your spacecraft: These are lessons where our customers learn how to use the controls, instruments, and systems of their spacecraft. They learn how to steer, accelerate, brake, and dock their spacecraft. They also learn how to monitor and adjust the fuel level, temperature, pressure, and other parameters of their spacecraft. They also learn how to troubleshoot and fix any malfunctions or errors that may occur during the trip. <br>Simulated space missions: These are sessions where our customers experience what it is like to be on a real space mission. They work as a team with other customers and crew members to complete various objectives and tasks in a realistic simulation of their destination planet. They also face various challenges and surprises that test their skills and knowledge. They also get feedback and evaluation from our instructors and experts on their performance and improvement areas. However, if you have either of these conditions, you are unable to go into space. <br>-High blood pressure <br>-Heart Problems <br>-Respiratory Problems <br>-Not passed High School",

Our vehicles are equipped with advanced technology to ensure a smooth and comfortable journey, and are regularly maintained to the highest standards to ensure the safety of our customers. The rocket's feature may vary depending on the price plan you select. However, all the safety, launch, etc will remain the same throughout the space ships no matter the pricing plan.Regular maintenance: Our spacecraft undergo regular maintenance to ensure they are in optimal condition for each trip. Our maintenance team consists of highly skilled and experienced engineers and technicians who perform various checks and repairs on the vehicles. Some examples of the maintenance activities include: <br>     -   Pre-flight inspection: This is a check that is performed before each launch to verify that all the systems and components of the spacecraft are functioning properly. It involves testing the engines, sensors, computers, batteries, communication devices, and other vital parts of the vehicle. It also involves checking the fuel level, pressure, temperature, and other parameters of the vehicle. <br>       -   Scheduled maintenance: This is a check that is performed periodically according to a predefined schedule to maintain the functionality and longevity of the spacecraft. It involves cleaning, lubricating, replacing, or upgrading various parts of the vehicle that may degrade over time or become obsolete. It also involves updating the software and firmware of the vehicle to ensure compatibility and security.",
